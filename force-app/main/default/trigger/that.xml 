  <title>Bank's Credit Check and Pre-Qualification Process for Loan Applicants</title>
  <description>
    As a bank, I want to implement a credit check and pre-qualification functionality to assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants and determine their eligibility for a loan amount and interest rate range. This functionality aims to reduce default risk by ensuring loans are offered to creditworthy individuals. It will streamline the loan application process, enhancing efficiency and user-friendliness. The system should accurately evaluate the applicant's creditworthiness based on their credit score and financial history, aligning the pre-qualification results accordingly. It should provide clear explanations of the pre-qualification outcome to the applicant and handle multiple requests simultaneously without errors or delays. The system should be secure, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of personal and financial information. It should be user-friendly, reliable, scalable, and compliant with financial regulations and data protection laws. The development should be completed within the allocated budget and timeline.
